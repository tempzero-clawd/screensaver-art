# Living Art Screensaver

## Overview
The **Living Art Screensaver** (`index.html`) is a standalone web application designed to turn a idle display into a dynamic, evolving art gallery. It leverages the latest in generative AI to create a "window" into imagined worlds.

**Live Demo:** [https://tempzero-clawd.github.io/screensaver-art/](https://tempzero-clawd.github.io/screensaver-art/)

## Features
- **Dynamic Living Art:** A mix of high-resolution static art with "Ken Burns" effects and fully animated 1080p video loops.
- **Always-On Overlay:** Minimalist title card showing the artwork's name and collection.
- **Interactive Side Menu:** Hover over the left edge of the screen to reveal the control panel.
    - **Playlist:** Scrollable list of all available artworks. Click any item to jump to it immediately with a fast fade.
    - **Randomize:** Toggle random playback order (Default: ON). When OFF, plays sequentially.
- **Ambient Mode:** Mouse cursor auto-hides after a few seconds of inactivity to keep the view unobstructed.

## Core Philosophy
- **Living vs. Static:** Unlike traditional slideshows, this gallery prioritizes *movement*. Static images are brought to life via CSS "Ken Burns" effects (pan and zoom), while "Hero" pieces are fully animated 1080p video loops generated by Google Veo.
- **Ambient Aesthetic:** The content is chosen to be visually rich but unobtrusive—perfect for a background monitor or wall display.
- **Multimodal Showcase:** The project serves as a proof-of-concept for stitching together:
    - **Text-to-Image:** (Nano Banana Pro / Gemini 3 Image) for composition and style.
    - **Image-to-Video:** (Veo 3) for bringing those compositions to life.
    - **Code Generation:** (Gemini 3 Pro) for the web container and logic.

## Technical Architecture
- **Hosting:** Deployed via GitHub Pages at [https://tempzero-clawd.github.io/screensaver-art/](https://tempzero-clawd.github.io/screensaver-art/).
- **Frontend:** A single-file HTML/JS app (`index.html`). No build step required.
- **Assets:** Stored in `gallery/`.
    - `*.png`: High-resolution static bases.
    - `*_animated.mp4`: Veo-generated video loops.
- **Configuration:** The playlist is a JSON array embedded in `index.html` (`const items = [...]`).
- **Playback Engine:**
    - Auto-detects media type (`video` vs `image`).
    - Handles cross-fades (opacity transitions).
    - Manages overlay titles ("UI Overlay").

## Future Vision
This isn't just a folder of files; it's a *curated stream*. The ultimate goal is for the "Nightly Surprise Build" to act as the museum curator, commissioning new works every night while the user sleeps, so they wake up to a fresh exhibition every morning.
